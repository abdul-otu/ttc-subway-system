# TTC Subway System

This project is a web application that simulates the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system. It allows users to input their current station and desired destination, facilitating efficient train scheduling. The project is divided into a frontend and backend component.

## Project Overview

The TTC Subway System project addresses the challenge of optimizing train scheduling for efficient passenger transit within the Toronto subway network. By leveraging modern web technologies and a user-friendly interface, this application provides a convenient way for commuters to plan their journeys and make the most of their travel time.
