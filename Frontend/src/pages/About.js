               <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
               Many people around the world rely on public transportation to travel from point A to point B.
                When traveling with public transport, knowing the schedule for a train or bus will help the user plan out their trip. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                This is important because trip planning has the potential to dramatically improve travel time for the user. 
                The issue of trip planning for public transport led our group to decide on a program to help alleviate this problem.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600"> 
                The program we decided to create is a Railway Management System. 
                This program will be able to help the user retrieve information about a trainâ€™s schedule as well as important information about the stations and trains.
